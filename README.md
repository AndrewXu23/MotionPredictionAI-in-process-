  Human pose estimation from video plays a critical role in various applications such as quantifying physical exercises, sign language recognition, and full-body gesture control. For example, it can form the basis for yoga, dance, and fitness applications. It can also enable the overlay of digital content and information on top of the physical world in augmented reality.


  This project consists of three files:
  
  HandTracking -- This file provides a tool that tracks 22 power points on human hands. 3D coordinates are recorded for further evaluations.
                  Camera will open to catch basic motions of the user.
                  
                  
  MovementTracking -- This file provides a tool that tracks 32 power points on the human body. A module is also created so that other projects can
                      import this function. 3D coordinates are recorded with highlight function, so that physical therapists can utilize this
                      tool to better help patients recover from surgical injury.
                      
                      
  FaceTrackGeneral -- This file provides a tool that tracks movements of faces in given videos for security use. A further developed version
                      is in progress...

AI will be involved in this project to predict the user's next movement.

Still in process...
